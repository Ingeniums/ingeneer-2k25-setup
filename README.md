# About
This repository contains the scripts and configuration for various aspects of Ingeneer 2k25, these include:
- Setup and updating of challenges
- Ngnix configuration
- Scripts for generating account credentials
- Scripts for launching the Platform and challenges instances 

It also includes code for an execution engine meant to be used for problem solving challenges, but 
it was never added as we didn't have much time for thorough testing.
