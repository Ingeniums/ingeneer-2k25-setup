description: 'A magical artifact hides in plain sight among Hogwarts'' network devices.

  The secret lies not in spells or runes, but in what the device itself reveals.

  Note: netcat to the shell and type the right command to see the result you want
  "type commands fully without abbreviations".

  For each network device, you can access and configure a view I created called ''participant''.

  When you enter a network device, type "enable view participant" and use the password
  "SuperStrongPassword".
