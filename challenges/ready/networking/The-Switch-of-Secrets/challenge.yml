  A magical artifact hides in plain sight among Hogwarts' network devices.
  The secret lies not in spells or runes, but in what the device itself reveals.
  Note: netcat to the shell and type the right command to see the result you want "type commands fully without abbreviations".
  For each network device, you can access and configure a view I created called 'participant'.
  When you enter a network device, type "enable view participant" and use the password "SuperStrongPassword".
