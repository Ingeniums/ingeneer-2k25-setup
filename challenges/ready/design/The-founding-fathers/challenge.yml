description: "On the founding father day, you have been tasked by Professor McGonagall\
  \ to design a complete visual branding identity for the original four Hogwarts founders\
  \ \u2014 Godric Gryffindor, \nHelga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin\
  \ \u2014 as if they were legendary houses or brands \nin a mythical magical universe.\
  \ ancient luxury meets medieval magic \u2014 each house must feel like a timeless,\
  \ \nmythical brand, each rooted in its unique values. You are only allowed to use\
  \ Adobe Illustrator as a tool, no ai or generated backgrounds are allowed, \nyou\
  \ must also create a new full color palette for each house\n"
