  On the founding father day, you have been tasked by Professor McGonagall to design a complete visual branding identity for the original four Hogwarts founders — Godric Gryffindor, 
  Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin — as if they were legendary houses or brands 
  in a mythical magical universe. ancient luxury meets medieval magic — each house must feel like a timeless, 
  mythical brand, each rooted in its unique values. You are only allowed to use Adobe Illustrator as a tool, no ai or generated backgrounds are allowed, 
  you must also create a new full color palette for each house
