description: "Greetings, Harry Potter!  \nWe\u2019ve been waiting for you.  \n\nHidden\
  \ in this enchanted forest are magical challenges crafted just for *The Boy Who\
  \ Lived*.  \nBut beware \u2014 dark forces stir, and impostors wield forbidden spells\
  \ to masquerade as mighty wizards.  \n\nTo prove you\u2019re the true Harry, you\
  \ must speak Parseltongue, the ancient tongue of serpents.  \nThe guardian snake\
  \ has hissed a cryptic secret:  \n\U0001F512 Parseltongue: `1K2NQRS_CXN25OUAEEOXGR{CEPLUIX3EY_R_TGLXNEOUEDONS}`\
  \  \n\nDecipher its meaning to unlock the path.  \n\nOnly then will the forest yield\
  \ to you.  \n"
