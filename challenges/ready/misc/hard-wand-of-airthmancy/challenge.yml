description: "High atop the Astronomy Tower, a whisper floats on enchanted air currents\u2014\
  an ancient spell, known only to those who study Arithmancy and elemental magics.\
  \ The wind carries only certain runes, and only the right incantation will bend\
  \ it to your will. Can you shape a charm the air will accept... and reveal what\
  \ lies beyond?\n"
