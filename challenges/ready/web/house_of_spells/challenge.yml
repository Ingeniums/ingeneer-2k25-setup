description: 'While wandering the castle one evening, you found a room you''d never
  noticed before. Its door stood ajar, warm to the touch, with a faded sign above
  it: House of Spells. Inside, an enchanted display listed spells by house - but the
  magic flickered. For a moment, something strange surfaced beneath: broken runes,
  forgotten enchantments... or protections long since unraveled.
