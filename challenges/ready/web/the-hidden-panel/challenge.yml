  You've been granted temporary access to a secure Hogwarts server - a curious artifact buried deep within the castle's enchanted network. When you log in, things seem... mundane. Nothing but a dusty scroll and a few harmless incantations allowed.
  But legends whisper of a hidden chamber - a place that only reveals itself to those who truly need it.
  Rumors among the Order say that some clever wizards thinking outside the box have tunneled their way through forgotten paths, exposing secrets never meant for Muggle eyes. If such a place does exist... you may need to bend the rules of magic to uncover it.
  The true flag lies not in what you can see, but in what you're willing to reveal.
  "Dobby knows of such a room, sir... A Room that appears when one is in great need... and it hides itself well."
